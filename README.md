# Global_Food_Inflation
This repository presents an end-to-end data science and machine learning analysis on global food inflation trends. The goal of the project is to explore, visualize, and model inflationary trends in food prices across different countries using real-world economic datasets.

###  Project Overview
Food inflation significantly impacts economies, especially in developing nations. In this project, we:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on global food price indices.

Clean and preprocess macroeconomic datasets.

Apply machine learning models to understand patterns and forecast future trends.

Visualize trends to inform decision-making and support economic policy analysis.

###  Techniques Used
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Time Series Analysis

Machine Learning Models:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Feature Engineering

Data Visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib
